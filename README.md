Super Orbulite World is a 2D platformer with RPG elements.  I wrote in C++ (with the Allegro library) when I was in college, and released it in June 2009.  It features six levels and three boss battles.

You can play it here:

Levels use the Mappy (FMP) file format, and the game supports creating your own custom levels.  Check out the level template in the custom level folder.

This game is quite old, but I later made a "spiritual successor" called Emerald Shores, released in 2018, which implements the same platforming-with-RPG-elements concept, but does everything a million times better.  You can check that out here:
